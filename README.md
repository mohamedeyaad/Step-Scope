Step Scope is a project developed as part of the Biomedical Engineering Course at the Faculty of Engineering, Ain Shams University. The main objective of this project is to design and develop a wireless, portable, and wearable system that utilizes inertial measurement units (IMUs) and force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) to monitor foot plantar pressure and gait in individuals with diabetic foot disease (DFD) or other neurological abnormalities affecting gait.

The system provides the following features:
- Real-time visualization of foot pressure using color coding
- Measurement of various spatiotemporal gait parameters
- Detection of gait events and phases
- Analysis of shank kinematics
- Estimation of the center of pressure (CoP)
- Assessment of patient stability based on FSR and IMU data

The collected data is transmitted wirelessly to a PC for visualization, analysis, and reporting purposes. The system is designed with a focus on professional wiring, communication, software, and user interface.
