This project is part of the Biomedical Engineering Course - at Faculty of Engineering Ain Shams University.
The project main goals is to design and develop a wireless, portable, and wearable system that utilizes inertial measurement units (IMU) at shank and force sensitive  resistor (FSR) at heel, first and fifth metatarsal, and mid-foot in foot plantar to monitor the foot plantar pressure and gait of individuals with diabetic foot disease (DFD) or any other neurological abnormality in 
the gait. 
The system provides visual color coding of foot pressure in addition to some spatiotemporal gait parameters, gait events, phases, shank kinematics, estimate center of  pressure (CoP), and also is capable of checking patient stability based on FSR and IMU. 
The system transfers the data to a PC for visualization, analysis, and data reporting, and it is developed professionally regarding wiring, communications, software, user interface.
The system is tested on healthy subjects and patients/simulated patients.
